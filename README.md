# Joypy Graphical User Interface

Copyright Â© 2018 Simon Forman


First draft of the GUI is done.
* Oberon-ish mouse chords
* auto-save with history

Still to do:
* Define words "locally"
* Browse history, examine, extract, jump-to
* Docs!  Lots of Docs!

Hmm...
* Active document support?
* Editing the Python source code?
* Display of formats (imgs, PDFs, &c.)
* Colors and fonts?
